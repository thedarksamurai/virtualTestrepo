    // from different countries.  If you chose your own countries, you may need to do a quick google search on your country
    // zone id.  The format is usually <Continent>/<City>

        // from here you will need to create three system outs to print out the times and dates

        // ZonedDateTime has a method called withZoneSameInstant(<ZoneId>) which gives you the exact date time in the
        // time zone you put in using tbe zone id.  Try putting in zonedDateTime.withZoneSameInstant(BRISBANE)...

        // after we grabbed the time in our country, we need to format the output using our DateTimeFormatter...

        // we need to format it in a way that is easily readable, for this assignment, use FormatStyle.MEDIUM

        // ... .format(DateTImeFormatter.ofLocalizedDateTIme(FormatStyle.MEDIUM));
